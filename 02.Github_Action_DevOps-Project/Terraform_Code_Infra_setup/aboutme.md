## Implementation Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1 Kubernetes Cluster Configuration
- Created master and worker nodes on AWS EC2 (t2.medium, 4GB RAM)
- Configured security groups with required ports (22, 80, 443, 3000-10000)
- Automated cluster setup using shell scripts for repeatability

#### 1.2 Self-hosted GitHub Actions Runner
- Provisioned dedicated EC2 instance (8GB RAM)
- Registered with GitHub repository using authentication token
- Configured with necessary tools (Maven, Docker, Trivy)

#### 1.3 SonarQube Server
- Deployed as Docker container on Runner instance
- Exposed on port 9000 for pipeline integration
- Created authentication token for secure pipeline access

### 2. Pipeline Implementation

#### 2.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
- Created `.github/workflows` directory with pipeline definition
- Configured triggers based on push events to main branch
- Implemented job separation with proper dependency management

#### 2.2 Build and Quality Gates
- Java application compilation with Maven
- Unit testing with automated reporting
- SonarQube analysis with quality gate enforcement
- Artifact generation and publication to GitHub

#### 2.3 Container Management
- Docker image creation from application artifact
- Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Secure DockerHub authentication and image pushing

#### 2.4 Kubernetes Deployment
- RBAC setup with service accounts and role bindings
- Secret management for secure cluster authentication
- Deployment manifests with proper resource management
- Service exposure via LoadBalancer (cloud-ready)

### 3. Monitoring Implementation

#### 3.1 Prometheus Setup
- Deployed Prometheus server for metrics collection
- Configured scrape intervals and retention policies
- Integrated with exporters for comprehensive monitoring

#### 3.2 Application Monitoring
- Blackbox Exporter configuration for HTTP endpoint monitoring
- Probe setup for response time and availability tracking
- Dashboard creation for application health visualization

#### 3.3 System Monitoring

## Node Exporter Configuration for System Monitoring

The Node Exporter implementation provides critical system-level metrics for the Runner VM:

1. **Installation Process**:
   - Downloaded Node Exporter package from prometheus.io
   - Extracted and renamed for better organization
   - Executed as background process on port 9100

2. **Prometheus Integration**:
   - Added Node Exporter target to Prometheus configuration
   - Configured appropriate scrape interval
   - Verified successful connection in Prometheus targets dashboard

3. **Grafana Dashboard**:
   - Imported specialized Node Exporter dashboard
   - Configured metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring
   - Set up automatic refresh intervals for real-time visibility

This system-level monitoring complements the application monitoring provided by Blackbox Exporter, giving complete visibility across the infrastructure and application stack.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive DevOps implementation that bridges the gap between development and operations through automation, monitoring, and security best practices. The pipeline not only streamlines the deployment process but also ensures quality and security at every step.

By implementing this solution, organizations can achieve:

1. **Increased Deployment Frequency**: Automation reduces the friction in deploying new code
2. **Improved Quality Assurance**: Integrated testing and scanning prevent defects
3. **Enhanced Operational Visibility**: Comprehensive monitoring provides insights
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflows with immediate feedback

The modular nature of the implementation allows organizations to adapt specific components to their needs while maintaining the overall workflow integrity. As container orchestration and cloud-native technologies continue to evolve, this pipeline architecture provides a solid foundation that can be extended to incorporate emerging tools and practices.
